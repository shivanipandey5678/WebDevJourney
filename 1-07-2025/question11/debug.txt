Question-
You are given a buggy React To-Do List component with the following issues:

The "Add Task" button sometimes adds empty tasks.
Completed tasks are not visually distinguishable (no strike-through).
The "Delete Task" button deletes the wrong task occasionally.
Your task is to debug and implement the following features:

Ensure only non-empty tasks can be added.
Tasks marked as completed should have a visible strike-through.
Ensure the "Delete Task" button always removes the correct task.
Write a short note explaining how you fixed each bug.   


Answer-
before adding task or event i will check  the value inside the input box if it length is greater than the after i will add it as a task.
if the task is completed then i will update the state value and apply text decoration over it carefully.
id you assign all event handler inside the same block it will catch the same btn whether it is click bt or delete btn .
appart from this you can use key which help u to indentify the exact list which has changed.after that you can apply element.remove it will remove that element from dom.

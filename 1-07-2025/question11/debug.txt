Question-
You are given a buggy React To-Do List component with the following issues:

The "Add Task" button sometimes adds empty tasks.
Completed tasks are not visually distinguishable (no strike-through).
The "Delete Task" button deletes the wrong task occasionally.
Your task is to debug and implement the following features:

Ensure only non-empty tasks can be added.
Tasks marked as completed should have a visible strike-through.
Ensure the "Delete Task" button always removes the correct task.
Write a short note explaining how you fixed each bug.   


Answer-
i used usesTate for managing state of component internally.
for css on completed task i use ternery operater and i gave classname dynamically .
after checking from useState i gave classname.and apply css on class
with the help of key i filter out the that task and delete and update thing .after updating thing with the help of setter function i set that as a main task.
before adding checking is the input box is empty or not after trim.

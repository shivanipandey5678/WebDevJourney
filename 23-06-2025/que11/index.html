        My name is Shivani, and I am from Delhi. I am currently pursuing a BCA with a specialization in Cloud Computing and Information Security from Amity University. Alongside my degree, I am enrolled in a course offered by TCS iON that focuses on Cloud and Information Security technologies.

        I have also completed a Full Stack Web Development course from Masai School, which has helped me gain strong development skills across both frontend and backend technologies. Additionally, I have over 3 years of experience in teaching, which has not only improved my communication skills but also deepened my understanding of technical concepts.
